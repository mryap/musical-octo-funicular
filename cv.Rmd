If you need someone who well versed from web design/development, analytics and data science, I am the candidate you need to talk to. 

## Data Science Standalone System
My workflow on a standalone system involves:

- R and Python for cleaning, pre- processing and analysis in a Jupyter Notebooks environment 
- Docker and Conda for [reproducibility](reproducibility.html) 
- Terminal/Shell command line for [GitHub version control](common-mistakes-in-using-github.html) 

## Web Design and Development

- After decades with Wordpress CMS, I made the jump to  [JamStack](https://hireyap.netlify.com/blog/from-lamp-to-jam)
- I built this website using the new RStudio Radix with Netlify that has an integrated publishing from Git repositories within 8 hours.
